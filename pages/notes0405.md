## Mock Interview
--- 


### Basic concepts questions

1. List the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning

Follow up:

- What are the supervised learning algorithms?

- What are the unsupervised learning algorithms?

2. What is selection bias? From sampling point of view.

3. What is reinforcement learning?

### Basic statistics questions

1. What is the goal of A/B testing?

2. What is p-hacking?

3. What are the differences between overfitting and underfitting?

4. What are the sampling methods? When you should consider use it?

### Basic algorithms concepts

1. Do you know principal component analysis? 

Follow up:

- Explain what is the term component? 
- When to use it?

2. What are the basic assumptions for linear regression?

3. How to explain a indicator regressor's coefficient in the logistic regression? HR question: Do you know generalized linear model?

Follow up:

How will you solve a logistic regression?

4. What is missing values? 

Follow up:

Consider a linear regression.

- Missing only in predictors
- Missing only in outcome

5. The difference between a validataion set and test set

### Probability

1. How can you generate a random number between 1-7 with only a die

2. Mr. Jones has two children. The older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?

3. A jar has 1000 coins, of which 999 are fair and 1 is double headed. Pick a coin at random, and toss it 10 times. Given that you see 10 heads, what is the probability that the next toss of that coin is also a head?

4. We toss a fair coin, if it is head, I give you 1 dollar, if it is tail, you give me 1 dollar. If you reach 20 dollar, you win, or if I reach 10 dollars, I win. Both of us start from 0, and dollar can be negative. What is the chance you win?
